            <h3>Wildlife & Nature Photographer</h3>
            <p>Wildlife Photography doesnâ€™t need much Introduction. What makes us go in awe is the amount of patience time and dedication most of the grand masters of wildlife photography usually put in to get a good shot. Unlike other genres this requires a huge bit of investment on the gear too, with some lenses weighing as much as 50 Pounds. Making any swift motion completely out of equation, yet the quality of pictures is always scintillating. I feel that wildlife photography has an important purpose: powerful images help connect people with our natural heritage and stimulate a commitment to conservation. Our planet is an amazing place, and we need to preserve its wonders for future generations.</p>

            <h1>About</h1>
            <h1>Abdullah Al Maruf</h1>
                <p>Wildlife photography is a loosely-defined profession which demands a passion for nature and art. Wildlife photographers make a career of traveling to remote areas and taking pictures of wild animals and natural scenery.

                Wildlife photography began as a hobby of safari hunters, in the early 1900s, who found photographs to be less violent and more permanent reminders of their adventures than the slaying and stuffing of a wild animal. Modern photographers often began as artists, biologists, or park rangers, and taught themselves the technical aspects of the field.
                    
                Classes in wildlife photography are offered at colleges and art schools around the world, and many organized safaris and expeditions also provide training and photographic opportunities. Wildlife photographs can be sold to greeting card companies, printed as posters, sold as stock photography, collected into a book, displayed in an art gallery, or sold to a magazine. Additionally, some wildlife photographers are hired full-time by nature magazines.</p>

            <h3 class="orange">Wildlife Photography Is All About Wild Animals</h3>
            <p>Wildlife photography is a demanding and competitive vocation. Traveling to isolated areas is expensive, as is the photographic equipment necessary for professional quality photos. The work itself is physically and mentally taxing, requiring patience and perfectionism. Because wild animals are wary of humans, wildlife photographers must use a hide to get close enough for a clear photograph. Hides are made of anything that conceals form and movement, such as a tiny tent with an opening for the camera, or a car with tinted windows.</p>

            <h1>Landscap Photography</h1>
            <h3 class="orange">Landscap photography Is Like Exploring A New Dimension</h3>
            <p>Landscape photography shows spaces within the world, sometimes vast and unending, but other times microscopic. Landscape photographs typically capture the presence of nature but can also focus on man-made features or disturbances of landscapes. Landscape photography is done for a variety of reasons. Perhaps the most common is to recall a personal observation or experience while in the outdoors, especially when traveling. Others pursue it particularly as an outdoor lifestyle, to be involved with nature and the elements, some as an escape from the artificial world.</p>
