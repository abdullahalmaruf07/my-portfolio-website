            <h3>Wildlife & Nature Photographer</h3>
            <p>Wildlife Photography doesnâ€™t need much Introduction. What makes us go in awe is the amount of patience time and dedication most of the grand masters of wildlife photography usually put in to get a good shot. Unlike other genres this requires a huge bit of investment on the gear too, with some lenses weighing as much as 50 Pounds. Making any swift motion completely out of equation, yet the quality of pictures is always scintillating. I feel that wildlife photography has an important purpose: powerful images help connect people with our natural heritage and stimulate a commitment to conservation. Our planet is an amazing place, and we need to preserve its wonders for future generations.</p>
